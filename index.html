      <h2>Global Literacy Rates</h2>
      <p>
        Literacy is a cornerstone of education, enabling individuals to read, write, and communicate effectively, which is vital for learning, personal growth, and participation in society. It serves as a key indicator for educational quality and development, often used by governments and organizations to measure the success of education systems and policies. High literacy rates are linked to stronger economies and better job opportunities, while low rates highlight areas needing improved access to education. Literacy is also a core indicator for global initiatives like the UNâ€™s Sustainable Development Goals, which aim to ensure equitable education for all.

      <h2>Government Expenditure on Education</h2>
      <p>
        Government expenditure on education is a critical indicator of a nation's commitment to fostering a well-educated and skilled population. Education spending influences the quality of schools, availability of resources, and access to education, especially in underserved regions. By analyzing the mean government expenditure across countries over time, we can observe global trends and shifts in priorities, especially in the years following significant global events or policy changes. This visualization highlights the average investment in education since 2000, offering insights into how different countries prioritize education as a tool for economic and social growth.
